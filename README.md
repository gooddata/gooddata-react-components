## Getting started
- [GoodData.UI Documentation](http://sdk.gooddata.com/gooddata-ui/)

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gooddata)

### Usage
With [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed, go to your project directory and run

The public API is exposed via global `index.js`. Except for the styles, do not import any other file directly
because they are not intended to be part of the public API.

### Deploy to heroku.com
When you deploy this repo to heroku, it serves *GoodData.UI Live Examples*.
Relevant tasks are in `Procfile` and `package.json`.

```bash
# run in the project directory
heroku login
heroku create <your-app-name>
heroku config:set DOMAIN_ADMIN_USERNAME=x@gooddata.com DOMAIN_ADMIN_PASSWORD=xy PROJECT_ID_TO_ASSIGN=xms7ga4tf3g3nzucd8380o2bev8oeknp
git push heroku HEAD:master
heroku open
```

### Run Live Examples Locally
To run *GoodData.UI Live Examples* locally:
```bash
git clone <this-repository>
cd  <repository-folder>
yarn install --pure-lockfile
yarn examples
```
Then open https://localhost:8999 and login using Live Examples account (you can [create one here](https://gooddata-examples.herokuapp.com/registration)).

### Run storybook locally for Geo chart 
Geo chart uses Mapbox to render map which requires a mapbox access token.
- Register an account and create Mapbox token as [guide](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/)
- Run storybook with token stored in `.env` for more secure
```bash
echo "STORYBOOK_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=token" > .env # only need to run once
yarn storybook
```
- Or run storybook with token env param exposed to cli (not suggested)
```bash
STORYBOOK_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=token yarn storybook
```
- Apply either above way to `yarn build-storybook` or `yarn test-storybook`

### Source code formatting
The source code in the repository is formatted by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). 
The format of the code is validated by our Continuous Integration server and is one of the requirements of successful merge.

Prettier is supported by every major IDE. You can find the list of supported editors and how to configure them [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html).

In the case, when your editor is not supported or you don't want to setup the integration, you can run the `yarn prettier-write` command to reformat the code before commit.
