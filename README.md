## Develop

### Running the development

To develop, you need to run the typescript compiler. By running `yarn dev`, the typescript compiler will be run in watch mode.
```sh
$ cd gooddata-react-components
$ yarn dev
```

If you just need to build the CSS files from SASS, run
```sh
$ yarn build-css
```

To see and validate the react components, you can use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
To run the storybook in development mode, run
```sh
$ yarn storybook
```

To deploy the production version of storybook, run
```sh
$ yarn build-storybook
```


### Running the tests

To validate using [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/), run
```sh
$ yarn validate
```

### Deployment
```
git checkout master && git pull upstream master --tags
npm version patch -m "Release v%s"
